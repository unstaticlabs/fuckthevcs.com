          We stand at the crossroads of a digital revolution. The path we choose now will shape the
          future of humanity.
          <strong>We all have the right to invest in and get returns from technology.</strong>
          Our movement is blurring the lines between <strong>investors</strong>,
          <strong>consumers</strong>, <strong>contributors</strong>. We are redefining the economic
          system with a new investment model. Democratizing technology and finance.
          <strong>Freeing innovation.</strong>

        <h2>Creating an equitable and sustainable future through open innovation.</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>We are Humans.</strong> We are workers, peasants, and peoples of the world. We are
          entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, thinkers, researchers, users, builders, investors. We
          are socially conscious individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are believers in <strong>the greatest good for the greatest number</strong>, measuring
          value not just in financial profits but in positive societal impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are advocates for our <strong>personal freedom and autonomy</strong> in the digital
          realm, defending our right to innovate and share without constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are supporters of <strong>a collective approach to innovation</strong>, where resources
          and knowledge are shared for the common good.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are upholding the <strong>principles of democracy</strong>, encouraging active
          participation and equal representation in the innovation process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are empowering <strong>transformative open technology</strong> to solve the most
          pressing challenges of our time. We only believe in the open, decentralized, and equitable
          kind of innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to <strong>continuous progress</strong>, always pushing the boundaries of
          technology to drive positive change. Yet, we assert that growth does not equal progress.
        </p>
        <p>We are determined.</p>
        <p><strong>Our mission is to free innovation.</strong></p>

          <strong>Human-centric progressivists.</strong> We believe in progress, but not just any
          progress. Ours is a vision where human well-being, equity, and environmental
          sustainability form the core of technological advancements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Democratic social technologists.</strong> Technology should not be a tool for
          profit, but a means to empower communities, uphold democratic values, and foster social
          cohesion. Technology should erase inequalities, not increase them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethical innovation advocates.</strong> Every technological stride must be measured
          not just by its brilliance or profitability, but by its ethical implications and impact on
          society at large. We recognize our society&#39;s and planet&#39;s fragility and advocate
          for innovations that not only respect but actively heal our natural world and better our
          societies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Inclusive visionaries.</strong> Our future is one where diversity is not just
          accepted but celebrated, where every voice finds a place in shaping our shared destiny. We
          embrace all identities and leverage the strength of community in empowering them.

        <h2>Redefining value creation through open innovation</h2>
        <p><strong>We aim to redefine value creation.</strong></p>
        <p>We prioritize collective innovation and societal impact over private profits.</p>
        <p>We stand for an open, decentralized, collaborative economy.</p>
        <p>We are committed to building the future of work.</p>

        <h3 class="inline-heading">1. Redefining the economic system</h3>
        <p>We no longer believe in the current economic system.</p>
        <p>
          Our &#39;capitalist&#39; economy has led to an undemocratic world dictated by finance and
          controlled by tech monopolies, at the expense of human values.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are modern serfs, sweating our dignity in exchange for digital dopamine shots. We are
          trapped in a consumerist illusion, acting as powerless users or buyers. We are passively
          watching our own extinction, made to believe there&#39;s nothing we can do. We are
          ironically hoping for random tech &#39;geniuses&#39; billionaires to save us.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It&#39;s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Our short-term profits-led economic system has created irreconcilable issues that turned
          into global challenges: climate change, loss of biodiversity, depletion of Earth&#39;s
          resources, wealth and wage inequalities, political polarisation.
          <strong
            >And we—the workers and younger generations—want to end this system that we did not
            create</strong
          >. We understand that we won&#39;t overcome these challenges without a drastic change in
          the way society operates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether &#39;Capitalism&#39; is the problem or not is irrelevant (in fact, Capitalism
          might have already been replaced with a form of Techno-feudalism, exploiting attention and
          platform rents, and it is far worse).
        </p>
        <p>Our current economic system is broken and it is our duty to fix it.</p>
        <p><strong>We, workers and consumers, hold the power.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Money is worth nothing if we don&#39;t play by the established rules. Our human labor and
          intellectual contributions have value beyond monetary measures.
        </p>
        <p>We resist alienation. We resist capital accumulation.</p>
        <p><strong>We want to contribute great, meaningful work.</strong></p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">The meaning of life. Why do we work?</h4>
        <p>We work because we are humans.</p>
        <p>
          We work to give meaning to our lives. We work to consciously, intentionally shape our
          surroundings. We work as a socially organized way to expand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individual motives might differ (search for meaning, mission, survival...), but,
          collectively, our work serves a society-level accomplishment.
        </p>
        <p>We work to create value.</p>
        <p>
          Value is a flowing abstract matter, it&#39;s an exchange of power. Capital, on the other
          hand, is an accumulation of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Value &#39;creation&#39; is trading one good for another, money for service, wage for
          skilled time. The amount of value &#39;created&#39; conceptually equals the underlying
          utility of the trade. And utility is defined socially—by us—: through markets, political
          structures, communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >We defend our human right to solely work for goals and missions we believe in.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">Value vs. Price</h4>
        <p>Value is what we want it to be.</p>
        <p>
          Value is all around us. Value is theoretical, highly-subjective, latent, speculative and
          immeasurable. &quot;Value is in the eye of the beholder.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>Value cannot be created. Value can be traded, actioned, and amplified.</p>
        <p>
          Price is what we pay to access traded value. Price is the instantaneous exchange value.
        </p>
        <p>In theory, free markets should ensure &#39;fair&#39; prices. Meaning that,</p>
        <ol>
          <li>We all pay the same price for the same good or service,</li>
          <li>It&#39;s the optimal (i.e. lowest) price we could have paid.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As utilitarians, we aim for the Pareto optimum: an optimal equilibrium situation where
          better for one would mean worse for others.
        </p>
        <p>We believe in free markets to find the Pareto optimum. Free markets imply that,</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Exchanges of value can happen freely (within the boundaries of human rights),</li>
          <li>Everyone can access and fully comprehend the marketplace,</li>
          <li>By design, no arbitrage (winning without risk) is possible.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Freedom is required to efficiently, democratically value things.</p>
        <p>
          We acknowledge that under constraint or influence, value is meaningless.
          <strong>For value to be, we must be able to freely want it to be.</strong>
        </p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">Money and False promises</h4>
        <p>Money is nothing more than the promise of an exchange of value.</p>
        <p>Throughout our lives, we all unequally collect &#39;valuables&#39; as capital:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time</li>
          <li>Influence</li>
          <li>Material and immaterial property</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Often, we perceive and want to access value in valuables that are not ours. (Maybe to
          provide for our material needs, comfort, or belonging.) In order to access or obtain said
          valuables, a trade has to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, trading valuables for valuables isn&#39;t convenient nor fair. Money is a
          convenient proxy-valuable, one we can all price equally. A &#39;commodity&#39;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Money was created as a means to an end: value &#39;creation&#39; (or rather value
          exchange). And indeed, it now is the most universal way to trade value.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, too often, <strong>money has become the end itself</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>We refuse to let money define collective value.</strong></p>
        <p>We won&#39;t falter in finding alternative ways to exchange our value.</p>
        <p>We won&#39;t hesitate to refuse exchanging our value for money.</p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">Growth is not progress</h4>
        <p>We oppose associating growth and progress.</p>
        <p>
          While they are indeed correlated, we reject any form of causality. Progress can happen
          without growth and growth without progress.
        </p>
        <p>Progress is moving forward towards a destination.</p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >If this destination isn&#39;t an equitable and sustainable future through open
            innovation for all, then we don&#39;t want it. We claim the right to disagree with the
            destination and disengage from the journey.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>We refuse ill-defined, uninspired, purpose-less growth.</p>
        <p>Growth is an increase in size. But the size of what?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GDP? The amount of money in circulation? For whom?</li>
          <li>Resources used? On a resource-limited planet?</li>
          <li>The number of species going extinct? What for?</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Growth isn&#39;t inherently good or bad. Neither is progress.</p>
        <p><strong>We deserve a better journey.</strong></p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">Degrowth and progress</h4>
        <p>
          We don&#39;t want to work more.<br />We don&#39;t want to consume more.<br /><strong
            >We don&#39;t want to always have more.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to innovate faster and bigger.<br />We want to invest more in meaningful
          progress.<br /><strong>We want to explore ourselves, our planet, the universe.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to work less.<br />We want to consume less.<br /><strong
            >We want to have less, but better.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>We want to live.<br />We want to love.<br />We want to laugh.</p>

        <h3 class="inline-heading">2. The role of open innovation</h3>
        <p><strong>The future of innovation will be open or won&#39;t be.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Open innovation is the only way to have healthy competition, one that benefits us all.
        </p>
        <p>Technology, techno-optimism, won&#39;t save us. Unless we join forces and cooperate.</p>
        <p>
          Our generation is faced with immense, life-or-death challenges. We blame it on the
          previous generations. We blame it on the system. Yet, the only way forward is together.
          Collaborative, collective, cooperative.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the sake of survival, we will bypass and confront the defenders of closed innovation.
        </p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">Individualism vs. Collectivism</h4>
        <p>
          We are individuals. We live first for ourselves.<br />We are communities. We live to
          belong to social groups.<br />We are humans. We live to care for others, and be cared for.
        </p>
        <p>We believe in agency, in individualism. And yet, we also believe in collectivism.</p>
        <p>
          The accomplishments of the free software movement and open source communities out there
          are testaments to the power of collectivism. And they did it despite the system.
        </p>
        <p>We believe that humans are fundamentally good; despite bad events and anecdotes.</p>
        <p>
          We celebrate the uniqueness of each individual, their right to think, create, and innovate
          independently. We recognize and advocate for the inherent power of personal freedom. We
          think that the diversity of thought and experience that each individual brings is the
          foundation for meaningful and deep innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We acknowledge the incredible potential of collective action, where shared goals and
          mutual support lead to greater achievements than any individual could accomplish alone. We
          embrace the concept of community, understanding that togetherness is a source of strength
          and resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We assert that the true essence of innovation lies in the harmony of both individual
          agency and collective effort. We strive to create spaces where individuality is not lost
          in the collective, but rather, where it is celebrated and enabled to contribute to the
          greater good.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in a world where individual aspirations and communal goals are not at odds but
          are used in synergies, driving us towards a more inclusive and sustainable future.
        </p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">Competition vs. Cooperation</h4>
        <p>
          Competition can be good; when it&#39;s a race that encourages everyone to run faster.
          Competition can be bad; when the narrow focus on winning turns into fistfights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cooperation can be good; when it pools knowledge and resources for shared goals.
          Cooperation can be bad; when it suppresses individual initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
          As techno-optimists, we too believe in competition. Because we too believe in evolution,
          and we too believe in life. We too believe in the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          We too believe rich is better than poor, cheap is better than expensive, and abundant is
          better than scarce. We too believe in making everyone rich, everything cheap, and
          everything abundant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet we believe cooperation is a whole part of evolution. In fact, we don&#39;t believe
          that evolution means letting anyone down.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in cooperation because we believe it to be the reason why the human race
          evolved so far and so big. &quot;Together we go further.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Our ability to cooperate, to suppress our primal instincts, is in fact our biggest
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>We are in the age of stories, the age of knowledge, the age of wisdom.</p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">Curating identities</h4>
        <p>
          Our identities are who we are. Our identities belong to us. Our identities are our values
          and our value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only we can curate our identities. Yet, digital platforms took it away from us; and
          corporate-exploited Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to go even further.
        </p>
        <p>
          As knowledge isn’t scarce anymore, curated knowledge will be. But curated doesn’t mean
          much in a vacuum or outside of the human eye. Curated only means something because we are
          alive, conscious, social animals. &#39;Curated&#39; equals identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identity curation gives birth to communities. Communities forge identity and amplify
          value. Communities rightly blur the borders between work, life, and the third place.
        </p>
        <p>
          We won&#39;t let AI curate our identities. We humans will organize. We will build
          communities to defend our humanity.
        </p>
        <p><strong>We proclaim our humanity.</strong></p>

        <h4 class="inline-heading">Resource allocation</h4>
        <p>
          The process of curation is the one of resource allocation: where is time, money, and
          influence being spent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe resource allocation should be here to empower; never to disable. We believe
          that the exercise of resource allocation should happen freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We claim that knowledge must be freely accessible to all</strong>, providing the
          foundation for informed autonomy and enabling the collective intelligence necessary to
          address systemic issues and develop collective ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We claim the freedom for communities to self-organize</strong>, and that societal
          structures should facilitate serendipitous innovation and resilience, ensuring that every
          individual has the same opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the collective
          effort to solve our biggest problems and achieve their own mission.
